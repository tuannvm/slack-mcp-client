# Requirements for Slack MCP Client

## âœ… Implemented Core Requirements

### MCP Server Configuration

- âœ… Only MCP servers defined in `mcp-servers.json` are considered during initialization and tool discovery.
- âœ… The client does not attempt to connect to or use hardcoded MCP servers that are not defined in the configuration file.
- âœ… Support for both stdio and HTTP/SSE transport modes through unified configuration.
- âœ… Server-specific configuration including timeouts, environment variables, and disable/enable flags.
- âœ… Graceful handling of server initialization failures with proper fallback mechanisms.

### Tool Discovery

- âœ… Tools are dynamically retrieved from the MCP servers defined in `mcp-servers.json`.
- âœ… No hardcoded tool names are used for initialization or tool discovery.
- âœ… The client queries each configured MCP server for its available tools during initialization.
- âœ… Sequential processing ensures proper tool discovery without transport timing issues.
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling for servers that fail to provide tool information.

## âœ… Implemented Advanced Requirements

### LLM Provider Management

- âœ… Configuration-driven LLM provider setup with factory pattern.
- âœ… Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) through unified interface.
- âœ… LangChain as gateway for consistent API across all providers.
- âœ… Automatic fallback to available providers when primary provider is unavailable.
- âœ… Environment variable support for API keys and model configuration.

### Slack Integration

- âœ… Full Socket Mode support for secure, firewall-friendly communication.
- âœ… Rich message formatting with Block Kit and mrkdwn support.
- âœ… Automatic format detection and conversion from standard Markdown.
- âœ… Interactive components including buttons, fields, and structured layouts.
- âœ… Proper handling of mentions and direct messages.

### Error Handling and Logging

- âœ… Structured logging system with configurable levels and component-specific loggers.
- âœ… Standardized error types with proper context and error wrapping.
- âœ… HTTP client with retry logic and exponential backoff.
- âœ… Comprehensive debugging support for MCP transport issues.

## ðŸ”„ Current Requirements Under Development

### Enhanced Tool Management

- **Tool Caching**: Implement caching of discovered tools to improve startup performance.
- **Dynamic Tool Refresh**: Support for refreshing tool lists without full restart.
- **Tool Filtering**: Allow server-specific allow/block lists for tool access control.

### Advanced LLM Features

- **Function Calling**: Native support for LLM providers that offer function calling capabilities.
- **Conversation Context**: Maintain conversation history for multi-turn interactions.
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and report usage costs across different LLM providers.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation

- **RAG MCP Server Integration**: Support for dedicated RAG MCP servers that provide knowledge base functionality.
- **Local RAG Options**: Support for local vector databases (Chroma, FAISS) and embedding models.
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: Automated ingestion, chunking, and indexing of various document formats.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Automatic injection of relevant document context into LLM prompts.

For comprehensive RAG implementation details, see the [RAG Implementation Guide](rag.md).

### Monitoring and Observability

- **Health Checks**: Regular health monitoring for MCP servers and LLM providers.
- **Usage Analytics**: Track tool usage patterns and performance metrics.
- **Alerting**: Notify administrators of service failures or degraded performance.

## ðŸ“‹ Future Requirements

### Security and Authentication

- **User-Based Access Control**: Implement per-user permissions for tool access.
- **API Key Rotation**: Support for automatic rotation of LLM provider API keys.
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all tool invocations and user interactions.

### Performance Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management for MCP servers.
- **Response Caching**: Cache frequently used tool results to reduce latency.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple instances of the same MCP server.

### Integration Enhancements

- **Webhook Support**: Allow MCP servers to push notifications to the Slack client.
- **Custom Commands**: Support for Slack slash commands in addition to mentions.
- **Multi-Workspace**: Support for deploying the bot across multiple Slack workspaces.

### Configuration Management

- **Hot Reloading**: Support for updating configuration without service restart.
- **Configuration Validation**: Comprehensive validation of MCP server and LLM provider configurations.
- **Environment-Specific Configs**: Support for different configurations per deployment environment.



## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Requirements

### Reliability

- âœ… **99.9% Uptime**: Service should remain available even when individual MCP servers fail.
- âœ… **Graceful Degradation**: Partial functionality when some services are unavailable.
- âœ… **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures.

### Performance

- **Response Time**: Tool invocations should complete within 30 seconds under normal conditions.
- **Concurrent Users**: Support at least 50 concurrent Slack users without degradation.
- **Memory Usage**: Maintain stable memory usage under continuous operation.

### Maintainability

- âœ… **Code Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- âœ… **Documentation**: Clear documentation for configuration, deployment, and troubleshooting.
- âœ… **Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate detail levels for debugging.

### Security

- **Data Protection**: No sensitive data should be logged or exposed in error messages.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs and MCP server responses must be validated.
- **Secure Communication**: All external communications must use encrypted channels.

## ðŸ“Š Compliance Requirements

### Data Handling

- **Privacy**: User messages and tool results should not be permanently stored unless explicitly configured.
- **Retention**: Implement configurable data retention policies for logs and audit trails.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Support for data export and deletion requests where applicable.

### Operational Requirements

- **Deployment**: Support for containerized deployment with Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring**: Integration with standard monitoring and alerting systems.
- **Backup**: Configuration and state should be backed up and restorable.

## âœ… Current Implementation Status Summary

The Slack MCP Client currently meets all core requirements and most advanced requirements. The system provides:

- âœ… **Robust Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with interface-based design
- âœ… **Flexible Configuration**: Support for multiple MCP servers and LLM providers
- âœ… **Rich User Experience**: Advanced Slack formatting with Block Kit support
- âœ… **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive logging, error handling, and monitoring hooks
- âœ… **Future-Proof Design**: Extensible architecture ready for additional features

The remaining requirements are primarily focused on operational enhancements, security hardening, performance optimization, and RAG integration for production deployment at scale.
